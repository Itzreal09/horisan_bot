## How to setup/deploy horisan.

### Read these notes carefully before proceeding 
 - Edit any mentions of @horisanbotsupport to your own support chat
 - Lastly, if you are found to run this repo without the code being open sourced or the repository link not mentioned in the bot, we will push a gban for you in our network because of being in violation of the license, you are free to be a dick and not respect the open source code (we do not mind) but we will not be having you around our chats
 - This repo does not come with technical support, so DO NOT come to us asking help about deploy/console errors
